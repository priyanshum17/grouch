# Installation

## Stable release

To install grouch, run this command in your terminal:

```batch

    $ pip install grouch
```

This is the preferred method to install grouch, as it will always
install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this 
[Python installation guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/) 
can guide you through the process.


## From sources

The sources for grouch can be downloaded from the 
[Github repo](https://github.com/priyanshum17/grouch).

You can either clone the public repository:

```batch

    $ git clone git://github.com/priyanshum17/grouch
```

Or download the [tarball](https://github.com/priyanshum17/grouch/tarball/master):

```batch

    $ curl  -OL https://github.com/priyanshum17/grouch/tarball/master
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

```batch

    $ python setup.py install
```
